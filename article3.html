            As the worldwide deaths dueto Covid-19 has surged past 125.000[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic_by_country_and_territory&oldid=950850541">Source</a>], We're still in for some more bad news:
            Ther're likely way more people succumbing to it than officially counted. For example, in the Netherlands the excess deaths have been estimated at between 1.700 and 2.000, twice the officially reported numbers

            A big issue is counting method. For example, in Italy only confirmed covid-19 cases who died in hospitals are easily added to the death count.
            People in nursing homes in Italy who quickly deteriorated died before the hospital could confirm with a test that they're covid positive and they aren't counted. [<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/italy-coronavirus-deaths-likely-much-higher/">source</a>]
            People are also only tested if they have severe symptoms. In the USA undercounting due to undertesting also happens, with some people's death certifacte lists pneumonia as the cause of death rather than covid-19 [<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/06/health/us-coronavirus-death-count-cdc-explainer/index.html">source</a>]
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Other nations, like Spain and Belgium, are also counting untested but likely deaths in their statistics. In Belgium their were 283 deaths today, almost 2/3rd among whom died in nursing homes and were untested and only a third died in the hospitals. [<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-belgium-carehomes/belgium-records-half-of-coronavirus-deaths-in-nursing-homes-idUSL3N2C22UY">source</a>]
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            As some nations with very high death tolls, like Italy and the USA, are underestimating their official death toll, the true extent of this tragedy won't be known until excess death statistics are released. But given the information available in other territories, it is likely that the true wordwide deaths ranges somewhere between 200.000 and 400.000 rather than the currently reported 125.000.
